    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>

    <h3>For Meat Mixture:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>2 slices of white bread, soaked in milk</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins or sultanas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apricot jam</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>For the Topping: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric (for a golden color)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice: Place the rice in a bowl and rinse it thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Blend or dice vegetables: Blend the tomatoes, red bell pepper, and optional Scotch bonnet peppers together until smooth. Alternatively, you can finely dice them.</li>
        <li>Saut√© onions and garlic: In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Add blended vegetables: Pour the blended or diced tomatoes and peppers into the pot. Cook this mixture until the excess water evaporates, and the oil begins to separate from the tomato blend.</li>
        <li>Seasoning: Add thyme, curry powder, white pepper, bay leaves, and salt to the tomato mixture. Stir well to combine the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add broth and rice: Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir in the rinsed rice, ensuring it's evenly coated with the tomato mixture.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer until it's cooked and has absorbed the liquid. This usually takes about 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Optional vegetables: If using, add green peas or diced carrots to the rice about 10 minutes before it's done cooking. This adds color and texture to the dish.</li>
        <li>Fluff and serve: Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Remove the bay leaves. Serve the Jollof Rice hot and enjoy the burst of flavors!</li>
    </ol>
