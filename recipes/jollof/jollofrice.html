    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil or red palm oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 large tomatoes, blended or diced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, blended or diced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons thyme</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2-3 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: 1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers for heat (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 cup green peas or diced carrots for added texture and color</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice: Place the rice in a bowl and rinse it thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Blend or dice vegetables: Blend the tomatoes, red bell pepper, and optional Scotch bonnet peppers together until smooth. Alternatively, you can finely dice them.</li>
        <li>Sauté onions and garlic: In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Add blended vegetables: Pour the blended or diced tomatoes and peppers into the pot. Cook this mixture until the excess water evaporates, and the oil begins to separate from the tomato blend.</li>
        <li>Seasoning: Add thyme, curry powder, white pepper, bay leaves, and salt to the tomato mixture. Stir well to combine the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add broth and rice: Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir in the rinsed rice, ensuring it's evenly coated with the tomato mixture.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer until it's cooked and has absorbed the liquid. This usually takes about 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Optional vegetables: If using, add green peas or diced carrots to the rice about 10 minutes before it's done cooking. This adds color and texture to the dish.</li>
        <li>Fluff and serve: Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Remove the bay leaves. Serve the Jollof Rice hot and enjoy the burst of flavors!</li>
    </ol>
