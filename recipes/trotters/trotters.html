        <li>4 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>4 cloves</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Ingredients - Gather and prepare all the ingredients as listed in the recipe. </li>
        <li>Clean and Prepare Trotters - Ensure the trotters are cleaned thoroughly. You may need 
            to blanch them in hot water for a few minutes to remove any impurities. Cut them into 
            manageable pieces if necessary. </li>
        <li>Soak Beans (if needed) - If you're using dried beans, soak them overnight or according 
            to the package instructions. Drain and rinse before using</li>
        <li>Create Spice Blend (Masala) - In a small grinder, blend the cinnamon stick, green 
            cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaf into a fine powder. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook Trotters - In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them 
            splutter. Add chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Add minced garlic, grated ginger, 
            and green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add Spices - Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and the prepared 
            spice blend (masala). Mix well to coat the onions and spices evenly.</li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes - Add diced tomatoes and cook until they soften and the oil starts to 
            separate from the masala.</li>
        <li>Cook Trotters and Beans - Add the cleaned trotters to the pot and cook for a few minutes, 
            allowing them to absorb the flavors. Then, add the soaked and drained beans. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add Water and Simmer - Pour in enough water to cover the trotters and beans. Season 
            with salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and 
            cook until the trotters and beans are tender. This may take 1-2 hours, depending on 
            the meat's tenderness and the type of beans used. </li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve - Once the trotters and beans are cooked to perfection, sprinkle 
            garam masala and garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Adjust salt and spice levels 
            according to taste. Serve hot with rice or your choice of bread. </li>
    </ol>
